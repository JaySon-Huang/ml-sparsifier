For each graph generate 3 sparse graphs:
	out/graph_name_coarsest.txt
	out/graph_name_mid.txt
	out/graph_name_finest.txt

So what does benchmark.py do?
	benchmark.py would read the original graph, compute properties
	Next read the other tree graphs and compute their properties.
	Output is stored in reports/graph_name.txt

What should final output look like?
	Final output should look like this:
	Original G. prop_name:value, prop_name:value, prop_name:value ...
	Coarse G prop_name:value, prop_name:value, prop_name:value ...
	Mid G prop_name:value, prop_name:value, prop_name:value ...
	Fine G prop_name:value, prop_name:value, prop_name:value ...
